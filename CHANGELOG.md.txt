Hello, Below is the Log of changes made to Kessler with the first version being here at the top and the newest versions appearing at the bottom creating 
a nice linear scrolling through the different iterations of my Final Major Project.


0.0.1 (3/3/23)

  This version set up the basic unity project, as well as importing all of the nessercery LFS support systems for GitHub and .gitattributes as well as 
  moving over my unity project folder into version control using GitHub/GitKracken, furthermore due to issues setting up version control before starting 
  unity development, this version also implemented a main menu that navigates to the start of the game which at this current time just reads "This is a game"
  for testing purposes as well as the basics for an options screen that's still in development.  

  ### - Added 
  
  - Added LFS to GitKracken using Git 
  - Added .gitattributes file to GitKracken 
  - Added Basic Unity Project 
  - Added the Main menu 
  - Added Options menu     

0.0.2 (3/3/23)
 
 This version set up a script to make the volume slider on the options menu added in the previous version work, by changing the volume mixer for the games 
 master volume to the value indicated on the slider by the player, furthermore this version added a graphics dropdown menu in the options page which was coded 
 and allows the player to change the built-in unity quality/graphics settings to a better graphical setting of their choice between Low and Ultra, hopefully, 
 this should make the game run smoother on low-end devices. 

 ### - Added
