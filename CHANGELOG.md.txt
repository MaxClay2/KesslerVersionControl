Hello, Below is the Log of changes made to Kessler with the first version being here at the top and the newest versions appearing at the bottom creating 
a nice linear scrolling through the different iterations of my Final Major Project.


0.0.1 

  This version set up the basic unity project, as well as importing all of the nessercery LFS support systems for GitHub and .gitattributes as well as 
  moving over my unity project folder into version control using GitHub/GitKracken, furthermore due to issues setting up version control before starting 
  unity development, this version also implemented a main menu that navigates to the start of the game which at this current time just reads "This is a game"
  for testing purposes as well as the basics for an options screen that's still in development.
