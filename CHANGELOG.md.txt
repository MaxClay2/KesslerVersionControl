Hello, Below is the Log of changes made to Kessler with the first version being here at the top and the newest versions appearing at the bottom creating 
a nice linear scrolling through the different iterations of my Final Major Project.


V0.0.1 (3/3/23)

  This version set up the basic unity project, as well as importing all of the nessercerynseamlessly LFS support systems for GitHub and .gitattributes as well as 
  moving over my unity project folder into version control using GitHub/GitKracken, furthermore due to issues setting up version control before starting 
  unity development, this version also implemented a main menu that navigates to the start of the game which at this current time just reads "This is a game"
  for testing purposes as well as the basics for an options screen that's still in development.  

  ### - Added 
  
  - Added LFS to GitKracken using Git 
  - Added .gitattributes file to GitKracken 
  - Added Basic Unity Project 
  - Added the Main menu 
  - Added Options menu     

V0.0.2 (3/3/23)
 
 This version set up a script to make the volume slider on the options menu added in the previous version work, by changing the volume mixer for the games 
 master volume to the value indicated on the slider by the player, furthermore this version added a graphics dropdown menu in the options page which was coded 
 and allows the player to change the built-in unity quality/graphics settings to a better graphical setting of their choice between Low and Ultra, hopefully, 
 this should make the game run smoother on low-end devices. 

 ### - Added

 - Added Code and settings to allow the volume slider to work as intended 
 - Added Code and settings to allow the Player to change the graphics quality of the game 
 - Added Quality text layer on UI Canvas 
 - Added Dropdown menu to Control game quality on UI Canvas  

 ### - Changes 

 - Updated CHANGELOG.md To include a new entry 
 - Changed UI layering back to Main_Menu first for testing purposes  

V0.0.3 (3/3/23)

 This version of Kessler added a fullscreen toggle button to the options menu in the main menu scene created in previous versions, this was tested by creating 
 a build of the game to test if the toggle worked as intended which it did however, upon testing this element I discovered that the camera did not 
 show the entire UI Canvas, this is not a massive issue as of yet but will need to be fixed in later versions. originally I thought this was a sizing of the 
 camera issue, changed the size of the camera and that didn't work, then I looked online and one page said I needed to change the UI canvas' render mode to 
 "screen space - camera" and then drag the camera into that however when I built it that didn't work either.

 ### - Added 

 - Added code and settings for Fullscreen Toggle 
 - Added Toggle to UI Canvas for making the game Fullscreen 
 - Added a "Builds" folder into Version Controlled files

 ### - Changes 

 - Changed UI Canvas render mode to "Screen Space - Camera"
 - Attached Camera to "Screen Space - Camera" 
 - Updated CHANGELOG.md to include a new entry  

V0.0.4 (10/03/23)

 This Version of Kessler fixed the issue found with the camera in the previous version where the UI canvas did not fit within the camera when the game was built
 to test the fullscreen toggle, this was fixed by simply changing the properties of the UI Canvas so that it scales with the screen size. Furthermore, in this 
 version, I added the second scene to the project which is an Introduction scene that explains a little bit of the worlds backstory and a bit about the main
 character Donald to nicely lead into the first level of the game 

 ### - Added

 - Added Intro Cutscene using Unity Timeline 
 - Added sound effect files for distant explosions and police sirens for use in Intro Cutscene

 ### - Changes

 - Fixed UI Canvas camera scaling issue when built by changing the Canvas to scale with screen size  

V0.0.5 (10/03/23)

 This version Of Kessler added the first draft of my main menu music titled kessler_menu_theme created by my music student composer Robin Clark to the project 
 and added it to a timeline connected to the UI canvas of the main menu and made it fade in and out for two seconds to create a smooth loop effect.

 ### - Added

 - Imported kessler_menu_theme into the project 
 - created a timeline for the main menu UI canvas and added a music file to it 
 - Created fade-in and fade-out effects to allow the music to loop accurately 

v0.0.6 (16/03/23)

  This version of Kessler added tile map assets that I created in photoshop and used to create the foreground for the first level of the game (underground 
  Bunker Tutorial), I added the image files into unity into their own separate folder in order to stay organized and then I had an issue with the sizing of the
  tiles in relation to the grid, however, I quickly discovered how to fix this by changing each image file within unity to be set to 64 pixels per unit since each
  the tile was made at a size of 64 by 64 pixels. 

 ### - Added 

  - Imported SunnyLand Placeholder asset pack from unity asset store (unused at this time)
  - Added Tilemap to "Bunker_lvl1"
