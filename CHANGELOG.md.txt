Hello, Below is the Log of changes made to Kessler with the first version being here at the top and the newest versions appearing at the bottom creating 
a nice linear scrolling through the different iterations of my Final Major Project.


V0.0.1 (3/3/23)

  This version set up the basic unity project, as well as importing all of the nessercery LFS support systems for GitHub and .gitattributes as well as 
  moving over my unity project folder into version control using GitHub/GitKracken, furthermore due to issues setting up version control before starting 
  unity development, this version also implemented a main menu that navigates to the start of the game which at this current time just reads "This is a game"
  for testing purposes as well as the basics for an options screen that's still in development.  

  ### - Added 
  
  - Added LFS to GitKracken using Git 
  - Added .gitattributes file to GitKracken 
  - Added Basic Unity Project 
  - Added the Main menu 
  - Added Options menu     

V0.0.2 (3/3/23)
 
 This version set up a script to make the volume slider on the options menu added in the previous version work, by changing the volume mixer for the games 
 master volume to the value indicated on the slider by the player, furthermore this version added a graphics dropdown menu in the options page which was coded 
 and allows the player to change the built-in unity quality/graphics settings to a better graphical setting of their choice between Low and Ultra, hopefully, 
 this should make the game run smoother on low-end devices. 

 ### - Added

 - Added Code and settings to allow the volume slider to work as intended 
 - Added Code and settings to allow the Player to change the graphics quality of the game 
 - Added Quality text layer on UI Canvas 
 - Added Dropdown menu to Control game quality on UI Canvas  

 ### - Changes 

 - Updated CHANGELOG.md To include a new entry 
 - Changed UI layering back to Main_Menu first for testing purposes  

V0.0.3 (3/3/23)

 This version of Kessler added a fullscreen toggle button to the options menu in the main menu scene created in previous versions, this was tested by creating 
 a build of the game in order to test if the toggle worked as intended which it did however, upon testing this element I discovered that the camera did not 
 show the entire UI Canvas, this is not a massive issue as of yet but will need to be fixed in later versions. originally I thought this was a sizing of the 
 camera issue, changed the size of the camera and that didn't work, then I looked online and one page said I needed to change the UI canvas' render mode to 
 "screen space - camera" and then drag the camera into that however when I built it that didn't work either.

 ### - Added 

 - Added code and settings for Fullscreen Toggle 
 - Added Toggle to UI Canvas for making the game Fullscreen 
 - Added a "Builds" folder into Version Controlled files

 ### - Changes 

 - Changed UI Canvas render mode to "Screen Space - Camera"
 - Attached Camera to "Screen Space - Camera" 
 - Updated CHANGELOG.md to include new entry
